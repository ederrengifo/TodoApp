# Doable

Doable is a small tool, my first app build in Rails, using Ruby, Javascript and basic HTML/CSS.

## Why does this product exist?

As I said this is my first experience with Ruby. I pick this simple idea because also was a common need from me of having an small and simple tool where I can manage my tasks, so I could rip off my physical agenda, and also with that having a place where to organize my links and some notes. I don't like to use the browser bookmark's. I work in more than one computer, in more than one browser, so I don't have everything in one practical place. That's why I created Doable.

Public release very soon!

## What do I need?

If you want to play with this version. You need to have any recent version of Ruby installed.

To run Doable, you also will need to install and configure [PostgresQL](http://www.postgresql.org.es).

To install the gems used in this project, if you don't have it yet, you need to install [Bundler](http://bundler.io), running the following command:

```
gem install Bundler
```

With Blunder installed, you can install the necessary gems using the command:

```
bundle install
```

This are the gems used in this project

- [Clearance](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance) - For authentication
- [Material Icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) - I used some icons from this library

## Can I contribuite?

Feel free to play with this version, but please, contact to me if you have ideas, requests or any change that will change master.

## What is the plan for the future?

This version will be the base for a future iOS app and a possible Chrome extension. Still in planning. Once that is finished and all the necessary tweaks are made based on the user's feedback. I'll start 1.0 version with tons of new features. But until then, no spoilers from my side!

Enjoy it!
